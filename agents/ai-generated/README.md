# 🤖 AI-Generated Playwright Suite

This branch demonstrates **autonomous QA agents** that plan, generate, and heal Playwright tests automatically — extending the core TekQA Playwright portfolio with AI-assisted test creation and maintenance.

## 🧠 Key Components
- **Planner Agent** → creates structured test plans  
- **Generator Agent** → produces runnable Playwright test scripts  
- **Healer Agent** → detects and fixes broken selectors or failed tests  

## 🧩 Folder Overview
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `plans/` | Agent-generated test plans |
| `tests/` | Playwright test cases generated by AI |
| `artifacts/` | Reports, screenshots, and visual baselines |

## 🧪 Example Output
The agents generated and healed end-to-end tests for the SauceDemo site, including visual baselines for key UI elements such as the inventory header.

## 🆕 New Mini-Suite: HN Search DDT (AI-Hybrid)
This self-contained example demonstrates the **AI-hybrid workflow** — a human-authored Playwright suite structured like an AI-generated one.  
It uses JSON-driven queries, robust selectors, and its own local config to illustrate maintainable Data-Driven Testing.

## 🆕 New Mini-Suite: Wikipedia Visual Snapshots (AI-Hybrid)

This lightweight example demonstrates a **human-authored visual regression suite** placed inside the AI-inspired folder structure — reinforcing the hybrid workflow of AI for planning & humans for reliability.

It uses Playwright visual snapshots (`toHaveScreenshot`), semantic selectors, and stable Wikipedia pages as a safe, public test target.
