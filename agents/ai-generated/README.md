# 🤖 AI-Generated Playwright Suite

This branch demonstrates **autonomous QA agents** that plan, generate, and heal Playwright tests automatically — extending the core TekQA Playwright portfolio with AI-assisted test creation and maintenance.

---

## 🧠 Key Components
- **Planner Agent** → creates structured test plans  
- **Generator Agent** → produces runnable Playwright test scripts  
- **Healer Agent** → detects and fixes broken selectors or failed tests  

These show how AI can handle parts of the testing lifecycle — while humans provide refinement, reliability, and real-world judgment.

## 🧩 Folder Overview
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `plans/` | Agent-generated test plans |
| `tests/` | Playwright test cases generated by AI |
| `artifacts/` | Reports, screenshots, and visual baselines |
| *(mini-suites below)* | Additional AI-inspired, human-authored suites |

## 🆕 AI-Hybrid Mini-Suite Index

A set of **human-authored**, AI-inspired mini-suites designed to demonstrate skills in:

- Data-driven testing  
- Visual regression  
- Hybrid workflows (AI plan + human refinement)  
- Localized per-suite configs  
- Clean, CI-friendly structure  

| Mini-Suite | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **HN Search DDT** | JSON-driven search validation against HN Algolia |
| **Wikipedia Visual Snapshots** | Visual regression of stable public Wikipedia pages |
| **DemoShop – Cart & Totals** | JSON-driven cart/total verification against SauceDemo |

## 🧪 Example Output (AI Agents)

The agents have generated and healed complete Playwright flows for the SauceDemo site, including:

- End-to-end login/inventory tests  
- Dynamic locator healing when selectors break  
- Visual baselines for header and inventory grid  

These demonstrate how autonomous agents can generate runnable tests that humans can refine and extend.
